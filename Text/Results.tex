\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Present the results of your simulations in this section. Use tables and graphs or other figures to illustrate your results. Remember: The table caption goes above the table, the figure caption goes below the figure.

The results section must include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Figures and/or tables that show the results of your simulation.
    \item Text that describe what we see in the simulation results (e.g. as expected we can see that XYZ which means the circuit functions as intended).
    \item NB! The result section is a \textit{what?}-section. \textit{What} where the results? \textit{What} do the figures/results mean? Any \textit{why}-questions you might want to write about and try to answer typically belong in the discussion section.
\end{itemize}
