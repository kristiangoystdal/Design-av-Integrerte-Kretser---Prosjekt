\section{AIMSpice Code}
Include all your AIMSpice code here. You might want to include snippets of it earlier in the text as well, but the entire code should at least be included here.

Remember to format and comment your code for increased readability.

\section{Verilog Code}
Include all your verilog code here. You might want to include snippets of it earlier in the text as well, but the entire code should at least be included here.

\section{Optional (rename based on what you put here)}
Sometimes one might end up running a lot of simulations, and then find out that not all of them were relevant enough to present in the actual report. Additional figures and results can then be included here (with a brief explanation so that the reader knows what they are looking at). This section of the appendix is optional, and might not be relevant for your group. 

Anything added here will not affect the grade directly, but might contribute to the overall impression of the work you have done (which is part of what we grade). Your grade will NOT be affected negatively if only the AIMSpice and Verilog code is in the appendix.
