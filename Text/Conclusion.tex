\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclution}

In this project we have designed, tested and implemented a MAC unit with two 2-bit inputs A and B which is controlled by a FSM following a specified behaviour. Trial and error show that a Mealy FSM results in less combinatiorial and sequential logic, compared to a Moore FSM, likely lowering the static power consumption. The functionality of the subcircuits, as well as the assembled circuit, has been verified using testbenches in Verilog. 

AIMSpice simulations show that a 1-bit version of the register used in the circuit, for the process corner TT at 27$^\circ$C, has a static power consumption of $\approx2.6$ nW with $V_{DD}$ set to 0.85V. Both process corners and operating temperature have a significant impact on static power.
