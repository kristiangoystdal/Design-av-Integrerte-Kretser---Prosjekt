\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclution}

We can conclude that both systems, the 1-bit register in AIMSpice and the full MAC unit in Verilog, works as intended. 

Static power consumption is low. 

% Make some concluding remarks. The length of this section should be somewhere between a paragraph and a page.

% The conclusion should include your key findings. Make the conclusion as concrete as possible by using numbers for the result (e.g. what was the static power consumption at a given supply voltage).
