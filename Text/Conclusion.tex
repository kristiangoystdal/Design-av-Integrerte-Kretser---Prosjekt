\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclution}

In this project we have designed, tested and implemented a MAC unit with two 2-bit inputs A and B which is controlled by a FSM following a specified behaviour. Trial and error show that a Mealy FSM results in less combinatiorial and sequential logic, compared to a Moore FSM, likely lowering the static power consumption. The functionality of the subcircuits, as well as the assembled circuit, has been verified using testbenches in Verilog. 

AIMSpice simulations show that a 1-bit version of the register used in the circuit, for the process corner TT at 27$^\circ$C, has a static power consumption of $\approx2.6$ nW. Both process corners and operating temperature have a significant impact on static power.

 


% Make some concluding remarks. The length of this section should be somewhere between a paragraph and a page.

% The conclusion should include your key findings. Make the conclusion as concrete as possible by using numbers for the result (e.g. what was the static power consumption at a given supply voltage).
