\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclution}

**Insert conclusion here**

% Make some concluding remarks. The length of this section should be somewhere between a paragraph and a page.

% The conclusion should include your key findings. Make the conclusion as concrete as possible by using numbers for the result (e.g. what was the static power consumption at a given supply voltage).

\subsection{Plans going forward}

Going forward we plan on comparing powerconsumption for different versions of the 1-bit register, to see what would be more efficient in terms of static power consumption. We need to implement a complete version of the circuit in Verilog, using both the FSM and the MAC-circuit. Here we will transition into using testbenches instead of timing diagrams to verify the results.
