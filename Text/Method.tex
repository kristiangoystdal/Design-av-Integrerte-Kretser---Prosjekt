\subsection{Finite State Machine}
\label{subsec:fsm_}






In this section you should explain what you have done, and how you have done it. The explanations should have enough detail to make a reproduction possible (i.e. it should be possible to do exactly what you have done, and receive the same results, only by doing what you write in this section).


It might be relevant to refer back to a part of theory, as explained in \autoref{subsec:theory_aSubsection}, to explain the design choices you made.

\subsection{Must include}
The method section MUST INCLUDE:
\begin{itemize}
    \item One or more illustrations showing your circuit. As a minimum you must include one figure of the circuit at the logic gate level, and one of what you implemented at transistor level in AIMSpice.
    \item Figure showing the state diagram for your final state machine (FSM).
    \item Explanations of design choices you made when creating the circuit.
    \item Explanations of the simulations you did (not the results, just how they were done).
\end{itemize}
